# Face Streamer

Face Streamer is an app that uses ARCore to track a face and stream its data to a remote computer using 2 protocols : OSC and TCP.

OSC is used to get face points information : face position, face direction, eye position, nose tip position, mouth position, mouth width and height (This feature list will extend as ARCore face tracking evolves).

TCP is used to stream in real time the face mesh itself to a remote Unity session, allowing high quality face filter and real time performance capture.
